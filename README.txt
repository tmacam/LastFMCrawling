This is a pretty ugly code that used DistributedCrawler
(http://github.com/tmacam/DistributedCrawler) to build a distributed crawler
for content on LastFM. The objective is to collect user chart information
(which songs a given user listened to), user social connections (who are this
user's friends?) and community information (this user is a member of which
communities).

We used it collect information about all users from LastFM Weakly Connected
Component and all "searchable" users, from Jan-Fev 2008. So, no matter how
na√Øve this code seems, it works, and it works really well ;)

For now that's all I can say about this project. The rest of this README is
TBD :)
